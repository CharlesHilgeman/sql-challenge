# sql-challenge

This code expresses my know-how in running through basic queries to find receipts in large databases.

The data_csvs folder contains all the pertinent csvs to achieve those queries.

The databases.sql file creates a schema for each of my data tables within the database and the sql_challenge_code file contains all my queries for pertinent information.
